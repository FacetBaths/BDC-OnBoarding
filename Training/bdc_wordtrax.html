    <h2>BDC WordTrax: Mastering Customer Conversations</h2>
    <p class="intro">You’re the first spark in our process—your words set the stage for quality appointments and big
        wins. Use these responses to handle objections, set clear expectations, and empower our sales team to close
        deals. Let’s thrive together!</p>

    <div class="objection-section">
        <h3>Objection: 'I’m not making a decision that day'</h3>
        <div class="objection">Customer says: "I’m not making a decision that day."</div>
        <div class="response">Reponse: "No worries at all! Our design consultant will give you a full rundown—pictures,
            measurements, product options, and an exact price—giving you the chance to decide right then if it feels
            right. If you choose to wait, that’s totally fine; we’ll hold your initial price for 90 days, offer a 10-day
            discount, and have tools to adjust if cost is your focus. We just want everyone involved to have that option
            from the start."</div>
        <div class="rationale">Rationale: This reassures them they’re not pressured, highlights the detailed process,
            and sets the expectation that a decision is possible. The 90-day lock and 10-day discount incentivize
            attendance, while the flexibility shows care, ensuring all decision-makers are mentally engaged for a better
            sales outcome.</div>

        <div class="objection">Customer says: "I don’t need everyone there to decide."</div>
        <div class="response">Response: "We get it, but our design consultant packs the visit with industry insights,
            material comparisons, and live design work—info that’s tough to pass on accurately. Having all
            decision-makers there ensures everyone gets the full picture and can grab any time-sensitive perks we might
            offer."</div>
        <div class="rationale">Rationale: This emphasizes the value of the appointment’s depth, encouraging full
            attendance without sounding pushy. It sets expectations for a comprehensive experience, giving sales a
            stronger chance to close by aligning all parties.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection-section">
        <h3>Objection: 'Why do you need my phone/email/contact info?'</h3>
        <div class="objection">Customer says: "Why do you need my phone/email/contact info?"</div>
        <div class="response">Response: "Great question! We got your info from one of our marketing efforts and just
            want to confirm it’s correct so we can stay in touch effectively. Rest assured, we won’t sell it or share it
            with anyone outside our team."</div>
        <div class="rationale">Rationale: This builds trust by explaining the source and purpose, addressing privacy
            concerns. Accurate contact info ensures smooth communication, setting up a quality appointment and reducing
            follow-up friction for sales.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection-section">
        <h3>Objection: 'Can you give me a ballpark price over the phone?'</h3>
        <div class="objection">Customer says: "Can you give me a ballpark price over the phone?"</div>
        <div class="response">Response: "I’d love to help, and our projects range from $3,000 to $80,000 depending on
            the scope. But it’ll make the most sense to have a design consultant visit to assess your space, design your
            project, and guide you on what’s essential versus aesthetic. That way, you’ll get an exact price and can
            decide how to proceed with confidence."</div>
        <div class="rationale">Rationale: Providing a range satisfies curiosity while redirecting to the appointment,
            where your detailed process shines. This sets expectations for a personalized quote, giving sales the edge
            to close with a tailored solution.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection-section">
        <h3>Objection: Other Companies Coming (Subtle Discovery)</h3>
        <div class="objection">Customer implies or doesn’t mention others.</div>
        <div class="response">Response 1: "We’re excited to help you get started—are you exploring options with any
            other folks right now, or is this your first step in the process?"<br>Response 2: "It’s great you’re looking
            into this—have you had any other visits lined up to check out your project, or are we kicking things off for
            you?"</div>
        <div class="rationale">Rationale: These open-ended questions subtly uncover if others are involved without
            pressure. If first, schedule early to set the standard. If others are planned, request the last slot to
            leverage your superior process and incentives, boosting closure odds.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="objection-section">
        <h3>General Non-Appointment Topics</h3>
        <div class="objection">Customer asks: [Any question outside appointment scope, e.g., 'How long does installation
            take?']</div>
        <div class="response">Response: "That’s a great point! I’ll note it for your design consultant to cover in
            detail during the appointment. Let’s get that scheduled so they can give you the full scoop."</div>
        <div class="rationale">Rationale: This keeps the focus on booking, ensures all details reach sales, and avoids
            overcommitting over the phone, setting a professional tone for the visit.</div>
    </div>

    <p class="note">Your knack for these chats builds trust and sets up sales for success—every win boosts your
        commissions. We’re here to back you up!</p>
    <div class="tagline">A luxurious look. A cut above.</div>
