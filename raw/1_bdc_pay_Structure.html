    </div>
    <p class="intro">We value your contributions and want to reward your efforts—because when you succeed, we all do.
        Here's how your hard work translates to pay, with opportunities to earn more as we grow together.</p>

    <div class="pay-section">
        <h3>Base Pay</h3>
        <p>$100 per week, paid weekly via direct deposit. This supports your availability for approximately 30 hours per
            week, focusing on inbound calls (Monday-Saturday from 8:00 AM) and outbound efforts (Monday-Friday until
            leads are contacted, rehashing as needed).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pay-section">
        <h3>Commissions</h3>
        <p>1% of every deal's balance is allocated to BDC commissions upon installation and funding. Currently, this is
            evenly dispersed among all reps (paid the week after funding). As we scale with better tracking, it will
            shift to straight commission—each rep earns 1% on the deals they set that close.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pay-section">
        <h3>SPIFFS (Performance Incentives)</h3>
        <p>Top appointment setter gets an additional $100 the following week. Appointments must be viable (no no-shows,
            reschedules, or out-of-scope leads)—we need real opportunities to close deals.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pay-section">
        <h3>Event Participation</h3>
        <p>Encouraged (not mandatory) to join us at vendor events. Pays $50-$100 per day, depending on the event— a
            great way to contribute and earn extra while supporting our growth.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="note">Your dedication drives our success—we're committed to fair, reciprocal rewards as the team thrives.
